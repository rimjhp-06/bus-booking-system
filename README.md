Steps to run the program -

1) Navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot project where the pom.xml file is located.
2) Run the following command to build your Spring Boot application:
       ```./mvnw clean install```
3) Once the build is successful, run your Spring Boot application with:
    ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
4) By default, Spring Boot applications typically run on http://localhost:8080. You can access your API endpoints at this location.

   Here we are having an endpoint /api/buses, you can access it at http://localhost:8080/api/buses.
